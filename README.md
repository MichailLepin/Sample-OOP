# Sample-OOP
Small educational task from my university program
1.In the first Python file (you can name it ’classes.py’) declare three classes with the following
attributes that are assigned through the initialization method:
 Artist (name, country)
 Album (name, release year, copies sold)
 Song (name, duration)
2. Add connection attributes in the following direction: an artist has many albums, each album
contains many songs
3. In the Artist class declare a method that will return an album (object of the Album class)
with the highest number of copies sold
4. In the main program file (you can name it ’main.py’) create a sample list of objects: several
artists, several albums, several songs. Make sure the objects are connected to each other
properly.
5. For each artist, print the most popular album (use the method defined in task 3).
